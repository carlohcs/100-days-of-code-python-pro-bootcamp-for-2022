# #100DaysOfCode Log - Carlos Henrique Carvalho de Santana

The log of my #100DaysOfCode.

Started on February 22, Tuesday, 2022.

## Log

### D1: 2022/02/22

I purchased the course: [https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). The idea is to learn new logic and think outside the box about some algorithms using [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/).

I've been doing a few interviews and I haven't been doing so well. Also, I've been feeling "stuck" in time. But now it's time to move on.

I will try at least 1 hour a day. Let's see what will happen!

### D2: 2022/02/23

I started to see the course [https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) and wrote the examples from [Cheat Sheet Booklet](./assets/Python_Syntax_Cheat_Sheet_Booklet.pdf).

Today the feeling it's "keep walking"! And how it's good to come back to study these things :)

### D3: 2022/02/24

I did a quiz from the course and this was the response: "You have been placed as intermediate. If you wish, you can skip ahead and start at Day 15."
I want to move to this day, but I know that I need to understand some "particularities" of the language as for example:
```
my_var = "{:.2f}".format(10)
print(my_var)

# Result: 
10.00
```

I saw some interesting links too:
- Replit: a browser-based code editor - [https://replit.com/](https://replit.com/)
- PyCharm: "The Python IDE for Professional Developers" - [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- Codding Rooms: The first real-time platform for teaching programming online and in-person that enables you to connect with each student, see their work, and engage with their code instantly. [https://www.codingrooms.com/](https://www.codingrooms.com/)

And finally, I did the "Tip Calculator" exercise to test some code.
