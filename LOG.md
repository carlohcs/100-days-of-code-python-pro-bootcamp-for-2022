## Log

### D1: 2022/02/22

I purchased the course: [https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). The idea is to learn new logic and think outside the box about some algorithms using [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/).

I've been doing a few interviews and I haven't been doing so well. Also, I've been feeling "stuck" in time. But now it's time to move on.

I will try at least 1 hour a day. Let's see what will happen!

### D2: 2022/02/23

I started to see the course [https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) and wrote the examples from [Cheat Sheet Booklet](./assets/Python_Syntax_Cheat_Sheet_Booklet.pdf).

Today the feeling it's "keep walking"! And how it's good to come back to study these things :)
