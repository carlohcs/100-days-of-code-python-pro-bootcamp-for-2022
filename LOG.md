I purchased the course: [https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). The idea is to learn new logic and think outside the box about some algorithms using [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/).

I've been doing a few interviews and I haven't been doing so well. Also, I've been feeling "stuck" in time. But now it's time to move on.

I will try at least 1 hour a day. Let's see what will happen!
