The log of my #100DaysOfCode.

Started on February 22, Tuesday, 2022.

## Log

### D1: 2022/02/22

I purchased the course: [https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). The idea is to learn new logic and think outside the box about some algorithms using [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/).

I've been doing a few interviews and I haven't been doing so well. Also, I've been feeling "stuck" in time. But now it's time to move on.

I will try at least 1 hour a day. Let's see what will happen!

### D2: 2022/02/23

I started to see the course [https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) and wrote the examples from [Cheat Sheet Booklet](./assets/Python_Syntax_Cheat_Sheet_Booklet.pdf).

Today the feeling it's "keep walking"! And how it's good to come back to study these things :)

### D3: 2022/02/24

I did a quiz from the course and this was the response: "You have been placed as intermediate. If you wish, you can skip ahead and start at Day 15."
I want to move to this day, but I know that I need to understand some "particularities" of the language as for example:
```
my_var = "{:.2f}".format(10)
print(my_var)

# Result: 
10.00
```

I saw some interesting links too:
- Replit: a browser-based code editor - [https://replit.com/](https://replit.com/)
- PyCharm: "The Python IDE for Professional Developers" - [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- Codding Rooms: The first real-time platform for teaching programming online and in-person that enables you to connect with each student, see their work, and engage with their code instantly. [https://www.codingrooms.com/](https://www.codingrooms.com/)

And finally, I did the "Tip Calculator" exercise to test some code.

### D4: 2022/02/26

I solved three exercises.
It was interesting to see again, some particularities from the language, as for example, the way how to create an 2d array and about the `indexOf` method from Python.
I had a lot things to do in my day, but was something good to achieve.

  - [Love Calculator](./days/04/02_love_calculator.py)
  - [Treasure map](./days/04/03_treasure_map.py)

### D5: 2022/03/01

I solved three exercises again: the most important it was the Password Generator. It was interesting to see the use of `random.shuffle(password_list)` method and how to append items in array: `password_list += item`.

Today was a hot day, where I was't enable to do anything. But I came back and here I am :).

### D6: 2022/03/08

I tried to solve a company interview test, but unfortunately I couldn't üôÅ.
The logic behind the idea does not appear in my mind.
So I'm going to keep trying, but I'm going to try to get some help with these exercises.

### D7: 2022/03/09

I resolved some exercises from [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and it was really good to come back again in these "degree exercises":

### D8: 2022/03/10

I tried to solve again the PING FREQUENCY test and now it's working!
I really have to thank to [@leomaurodesenv](https://github.com/leomaurodesenv) to help me with this contest! I will be always grateful.

I'm really happy!

### D9: 2022/04/19

Just commiting what I had done before:

Resolution of socks test;
Resolution of lowest triangle test.

I tried to solve the game with cells, but I had to consult on internet - I almost get the solution!
